# **Urban Transit Optimization and Fare Prediction (NYC Taxi Analytics)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **NYC taxi trip data** to uncover key patterns in **urban mobility, demand hotspots, fare prediction, and passenger behavior**. Using **big data techniques and machine learning models**, we aim to optimize **taxi transit, predict fares, and enhance urban transportation efficiency**.

## 📊 Dataset Information
This project is based on the **NYC Taxi Trip Dataset**, which includes millions of ride records collected by the **NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**. The dataset contains:

- **Pickup & Drop-off Timestamps** – Time of trip initiation and completion.
- **Pickup & Drop-off Locations** – GPS coordinates of trip start and end.
- **Trip Distance** – Distance covered in miles.
- **Fare Amount** – Total trip cost, including base fare, taxes, and surcharges.
- **Payment Type** – Whether the payment was made by **cash or card**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:
✅ **Identify high-demand regions** for taxis through **heatmap visualization**.  
✅ **Predict taxi trip duration** based on pickup/drop-off locations and time of travel.  
✅ **Segment passengers** based on trip characteristics (distance, fare, time, payment method).  
✅ **Predict the likelihood of cash vs. card payment** for a given ride.  
✅ **Estimate fare amounts** based on pickup/drop-off locations across different boroughs.  
✅ **Predict tip amounts** based on ride characteristics.  
✅ **Classify trips into high-fare and low-fare categories**.  
✅ **Identify and predict traffic congestion hotspots**.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Big Data Processing:** `PySpark`, `Pandas`
- **Machine Learning Models:** `MLlib`, `scikit-learn`
- **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Folium` (for heatmaps)
- **Data Handling:** `Parquet`, `SQL`
- **Notebook Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights & Results
- Mapped high-demand taxi zones across NYC using heatmaps.
- Accurately predicted taxi fares based on borough-specific characteristics.
- Segmented passengers into behavioral categories for ride optimization.
- Developed a congestion forecasting model to assist city planners.

## 🔥 Future Work
- Enhance fare prediction with deep learning models.
- Incorporate real-time streaming data from NYC taxis.
- Expand congestion forecasting using traffic and weather data.
